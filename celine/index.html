    <h1>A Letter to Fellow Freedom Fighters</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">From Celine Assaf-Boustani</div>
    <div class="letter">
        <p>Dear Fellow Freedom Fighters,</p>
        <p>
            The most important thing to advance freedom is to create communities. If you want to truly move the needle for liberty, start by building a community that feels united—a community where there is solidarity, where innovation flourishes, and where we are aligned on core values. But just as importantly, we must foster enough trust to disagree, to challenge each other's worldviews, and to support one another through those differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Freedom is not a solitary pursuit. It is a collective journey, built on the bonds we form with one another. When we come together, not only in agreement but also in honest debate, we create the fertile ground where new ideas can take root and where courage is multiplied. Our unity is our strength, but our willingness to question, to innovate, and to support each other—especially when we disagree—is what makes our movement resilient and enduring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us continue to build these communities with open hearts and open minds. Let us stand together, not just in solidarity, but in the spirit of growth, innovation, and mutual respect. This is how we advance freedom—not just for ourselves, but for all.
        </p>
