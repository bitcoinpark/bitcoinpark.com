Bitcoin miners now operate across oil fields, residential heating systems, and grid-scale facilities, demonstrating mastery of curtailment and energy arbitrage. Yet the conversation no longer belongs to miners alone. The entry of artificial intelligence, HPC workloads, and innovative generation sources signals an expanded ecosystem of large-scale energy consumers. This report argues for widening the tent: by engaging cross-industry dialogue, miners, technologists, and new power producers can collectively advance methods for capturing value from energy in ways that drive efficiency, resilience, and market-driven innovation.",,,,,,,,
